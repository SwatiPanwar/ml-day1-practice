Step by Step Explanation

Dataset: Small simulated telecom dataset.

Train/Test Split: Model train + unseen data test.

Feature Scaling: Logistic Regression sensitive to scale → StandardScaler use.

Model + GridSearchCV:

Hyperparameter grid = C + solver

CV = 3 folds → evaluate each combination → best selected

Test Evaluation: Check accuracy and report → real life: business confidence

User Input Prediction:

Input: tenure, charges, contract

Model predicts churn → output friendly message
